# Housing-Analysis
 I analyzed a dataset containing information about various real estate properties. The dataset included features such as price, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and several other attributes. The goal was to derive meaningful insights and perform some basic data transformations.

I utilized the groupby function to aggregate data based on various criteria. For example, I  calculated the average price for houses with different numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms.

I used nlargest to identify the top 10 highest-priced houses based on the 'price' column. I also used nsmallest to identify the top 10 lowest-priced houses -priced houses based on the 'price' column.

FROM MY ANALYSIS, THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL BUSINESS PROBLEMS AND QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED 

1. Price Categorization:

I categorized properties into 'High' and 'Low' based on5 a price threshold of 5 million. This can help in creating targeted marketing strategies and understanding the market segments for different price ranges.

2. Average Prices by Bedrooms and Bathrooms:

I analyzed the average prices based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. 
This information is valuable for property developers and sellers to understand pricing trends and preferences among buyers.

3.Identification of Extreme Values

I used nlargest and nsmallest to identify the top highest-priced houses and the smallest areas. This information  can be useful for various purposes, such as understanding luxury property trends or identifying opportunities in the market.

4. Pricing Strategy

Knowing the distribution of houses based on bedrooms and bathrooms can inform pricing strategies. Houses with more bedrooms or bathrooms may command higher prices, and understanding this distribution helps in setting competitive and market-driven prices.


5. Investment Decisions

For property investors, understanding the distribution of furnishing statuses can guide investment decisions. For instance, if there's a trend towards furnished properties, it might be beneficial to invest in furnishing additional properties.
